Information Center Management System is a project developed in C, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, and updating new information, searching books and members and return books. It gives us the complete information about the library. It tracks the records of the number of books in the library or how many books are issued or how many books have been returned or renewed or late fine charges. We can enter the record of new books, retrieve the details of books and also stock available in the library.
