# INFORMATION CENTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

**INTRODUCTION**

Information Center Management System is a software that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps librarian to maintain the database of new books and the books that are borrowed by members along with their due dates. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. This system completely automates all our library’s activities. The best way to maintain, organize and handle countless books systematically is to implement a information center management system software. 

The project “Information Center Management System” is developed in C, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, and updating new information, searching books and members and return books. It gives us the complete information about the library. It tracks the records of the number of books in the library or how many books are issued or how many books have been returned or renewed or late fine charges. We can enter the record of new books, retrieve the details of books and also stock available in the library. 

**OBJECTIVES**

* To manage all the details about members, books, issues and students
* To track all the details about books, students and issues
* To build a monitoring system that is able to monitor and manage all library operations efficiently
* Give an opportunity to librarians to reduce mistakes that always happen during manual method
* To store properly the library items in order to maintain their security

**BENEFITS**

* Secure and Reliable
* Simple and Easy to Use
* Increases Efficiency
* Record Maintenance
* Saves Time and Cost

**FEATURES**

* Online access
* Barcode Scanning
* Self management

Who

This Information Center Management System is an application is used by all the students, and staff who are having id's.

What:

Information Center Management Systems is software that helps to maintain a database that is useful to enter new books & record books borrowed by the members, with the respective submission dates.

When:

This Information Center Management System is very useful when there are large no of readers visit library to return, renewal, or take books. It is very tedious to enter the records manually so here this project come into handy.

Where:

The Information Center management system is nowadays essential for schools, colleges, private libraries, and other organizations. They can use this software as the purpose of books issuing and returning for renewal.

How:

This project is implemented to do the book issuing, retunrn, or renewal purpose by entering the student or faculty id as input.

Swot Analysis:

Strengths:

a) Simple & Easy to Use
b) Increased Library Engagement
c) Efficient Cloud Data Management
d) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable
e) Mobile Access

Weakness:

a) The data stored is prone to cyber hacks
b) Costly and Expensive
c) Complicated to operate
d) Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity
e) Risk of computer virus

Opportunities:

The LMS leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of library systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. With an increasing move towards closed platforms (like Facebook, for example) and proprietary ecosystems (like Apple), libraries will be required tonavigate these different spaces and ecosystems.

Threats:

Libraries now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some libraries don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.
